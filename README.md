# TrainTrackGUI

Welcome to the TrainTrackGUI GitHub repository! TrainTrackGUI is a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) application designed for controlling model trains. This application is developed using C++ and the Qt library, offering intuitive controls over train operations, including starting, stopping, direction changes, and advanced functionalities such as track switching and LED control within the home station. TrainTrackGUI supports the management of multiple trains simultaneously, making it an ideal tool for model train enthusiasts who wish to bring automation and precision to their setups.

## Features

- **Train Control**: Start, stop, and change the direction of multiple trains with ease.
- **Track Switching**: Control track switchers to change the path of your trains, ensuring smooth transitions between tracks.
- **LED Control**: Manage the LEDs inside the home station to indicate train statuses and operations. Advanced settings allow for individual LED control and custom naming.
- **Multi-Train Management**: Seamlessly control and monitor multiple trains simultaneously for complex track layouts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive GUI built with Qt, making train and track management accessible to everyone.
- **Advanced Settings**: Dive into advanced settings for precise control over each aspect of your train setup, including detailed LED configuration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use TrainTrackGUI, you'll need:
